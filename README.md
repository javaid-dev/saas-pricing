### **Key Features**

#### **1. Dynamic Pricing Model with AI**

<p align="center">
  <img alt="AI-Powered Dynamic Pricing" title="AI-Powered Dynamic Pricing" src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x200">
</p>

- **Description**: This platform uses **AI/ML models** to analyze user behavior and usage patterns, allowing for **dynamic pricing** adjustments based on customer segments, demand, and usage.
- **How It Works**: Data from user interactions and transactions are fed into **TensorFlow** models, which predict optimal pricing strategies. This enables the platform to adjust pricing dynamically to match market demand and customer behavior in real time.

</p>

- **Description**: **Predictive analytics** is used to anticipate customer behavior based on historical data. This helps businesses understand when to offer discounts, change pricing, or push for upselling.
- **How It Works**: **TensorFlow** models are trained using customer interaction data, and these models predict future behavior, such as potential churn or increased usage. The platform adjusts the SaaS pricing strategy to maximize revenue based on these predictions.

</p>

- **Description**: The platform integrates with **Stripe** to automate billing based on real-time usage and the dynamically adjusted pricing models. It supports both **subscription-based** and **usage-based** billing.
- **How It Works**: Once the AI model determines the optimal pricing, Stripe automatically generates invoices based on the user’s subscription or usage. Stripe's robust API ensures seamless billing and payment processing.

#### **4. Model Deployment and Scaling with AWS Sagemaker**

<p align="center">
  <img alt="AWS Sagemaker Model Deployment" title="AWS Sagemaker" src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x200">
</p>

- **Description**: The machine learning models are trained and deployed on **AWS Sagemaker**, enabling the platform to scale effortlessly as the user base grows. AWS Sagemaker allows for retraining models based on new data and usage patterns.
- **How It Works**: **AWS Sagemaker** handles the training and deployment of the machine learning models. As new customer data becomes available, the models are automatically retrained to ensure that pricing strategies remain effective and up to date.

### **Architecture**
The architecture consists of an **AI-driven backend** powered by **TensorFlow** for predictive modeling and **AWS Sagemaker** for model management. The pricing engine is integrated with **Stripe** for automated billing, while the backend services are developed in **Spring Boot** to ensure scalability and performance.

#### **Core Components**:
- **TensorFlow**: Provides the AI/ML models for predictive analytics and dynamic pricing.
- **AWS Sagemaker**: Manages model training, deployment, and scaling.
- **Stripe API**: Handles automated billing and payment processing.
- **Spring Boot**: Manages backend logic for data processing and model integration.

### **Challenges Solved**
- **Revenue Maximization**: The AI-based pricing engine helps businesses optimize their pricing strategy to increase revenue, adapting to customer behavior in real-time.
- **Churn Reduction**: Predictive analytics helps businesses identify potential customer churn and take action by offering personalized discounts or pricing adjustments.
- **Seamless Billing**: Integrating Stripe ensures a smooth, automated billing process that adjusts dynamically based on the user’s subscription plan and usage.

### **Impact**
- Increased SaaS revenue by **15%** through dynamic pricing adjustments.
- Reduced customer churn by **10%** with personalized pricing strategies based on predictive analytics.
- Streamlined billing, reducing manual intervention by **80%**, improving operational efficiency.
